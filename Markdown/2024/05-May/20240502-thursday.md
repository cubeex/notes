## Getting Started
An overview of Markdown, how it works, and what you can do with it.

### What is Markdown?
- A lightweight markup language
- Can be used to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.
- Was created by John Gruber in 2004
- Is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.
- It's different than using a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor.
  - Changes ARE NOT made by clicking on buttons to format words and phrases
  - Changes ARE NOT visible immediately
  - Markdown syntax is added to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.
    - Example: # That hashtag makes this a heading
               **Everything inside of these asterisks is BOLD**
- Markdown formatting elements can be added by
    using any text editor application
      or
    using one of the many Markdown applications for any moderm OS (Operating System: Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS) 
- Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive
  - It is designed to be as readable as possible
  - It can be published as-is, as plain text

### Why Use Markdown?
- It can be used for everything
  - To create:
    - websites
    - documents
    - notes
    - books
    - presentations
    - email messages
    - technical documentation
- It is portable
  - It can be used with almost any application 
  - You can dump applications, move to new ones and not worry about reformatting the document
- It is platform independent
  - Use any device and any OS
- It is future proof
  - If the app you're using stops working, you can still read it on a text editor
  - Important for work or university docs like old MS Word that can't be used anymore
- It is everywhere like the flu

### Kicking the Tires
- The best way to learn Markdown is to use it!!
- No need to download anything
- Dillinger is one of the best online Markdown editors

### How Does it (Dillinger) Work?
- It hides the stuff happening behind the scenes
  - AKA the good sutff!!
- The text is stored in a plaintext file with a .md (.markdown) extension then it gets converted by the application... 
    8^\
- Markdown apps use a Markdown processor (AKA parser or implementation) to output the .md to .html
- Summary:
  - Four-part process:
    1. Crate a .md file using a text editor or .md app.
    2. Open .md in a .md app
    3. Convert .md to .hmtl w/ .md app
    4. View .html in web browser or convert .md to .pdf or other format with .md app
  - Different apps do it slightly differently

### What's Markdown Good For?

- Create content for websites
- Create print-ready docs

        - MarkdownGuide.com was created with Jekyll. Source code on github.
